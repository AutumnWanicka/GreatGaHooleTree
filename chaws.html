            <p>On a certain day they are selected for their chaws. These chaws are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation</li>
                <li>Tracking</li>
                <li>Weather</li>
                <li>Coillering</li>
                <li>Search and Rescue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            When the owls are still young the are not in chaws. They have to take classes first.
                The owls have to take classes for about one year. Then on one day of the year all the owls that are ready to be
                put in a chaw are put in one. It is not randon though the gaurdians and council chose.
                Each chaw has an item for the chosing day. The gaurdians and council put the item for each chaw under their bed sheets.
                The owls that are being chosen chaws are somewhere else during that time.
                 Then the owls come back and find out their chaws.
