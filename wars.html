                Most of the later books have wars. The Great Ga'Hoole Tree usualy have spies searching for the ememies after the first wars. When they see something peculiar the report to the king. If he decideds to attack they prepare for war. Sometimes the owls of the guardians of Ga'Hoole are not ready for war and have to get the weapons while the ememy is attacking.

                The wars are not boring in the books. They do close up of some owls and talk about that fight. They also do a description of the whole war. The wars are very interesting. The wars which are about a chapter are not short. Wars are very interesting.
