            <p> The Great Ga'Hoole Tree is a series of books. I woukd like to tell you about it. The Great Ga'Hoole Tree is a big tree with lots of owls living in it. Those owls learn different chaws. A chaw is a group of owls with a older leader to teach them a skill. But before they get in a chaw they have to learn the basics. Such as navigation and Ga'Hoolagy</p>
            <p>
                The owls sleep in hollows with a few other owls. The owls basicly live with their hollow mates. Their hollow mates can become very close friends. Tweener is the meal right after the owls get up. For people that would be when we go to bed. Breaklight is right before they go to bed. For people that would be when we get up. The Great Ga'Hoole Tree has a big library with all kinds of books. The owls love to go there in their free time. They can wake up when ever they want and go to the library.</p>
