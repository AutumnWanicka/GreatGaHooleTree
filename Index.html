        <h1>The great Ga'Hoole Tree.</h1>
        <p> The Great Ga'Hoole Tree is a series of books.I woukd like to tell you about it.
            The Great Ga'Hoole Tree is a big tree with lots of owls living in it. Those owls learn different chaws.
            A chaw is a group of owls with a older leader to teach them a skill.
             But before they get in a chaw they have to learn the basics. Such as navigation and Ga'Hoolagy</p>

        <p> On a certain day they are selected for their <a href="chaws.html">chaws</a>.
             These chaws are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigation</li>
            <li>Tracking</li>
            <li>Weather</li>
            <li>Coillering</li>
            <li>Search and Rescue</li>
        </ul>


        <p>For Navigation they learn how to navigation many ways such as the stars. In tracking they learn how to track.
            The weather chaw teaches how to flu in weather such as strong wind.
            For coillering the learn how to collect coals in a forest fire.
             They also have to tack the weather chaw for the coillering chaw.
             For Search and Rescue they save baby owls and take them to the Grea Ga'Hoole Tree.
             Even when they are in chaws the have to take classes.</p>

        <p>Tweener is the meal right after the owls get up. For people that would be when we go to bed.
        Breaklight is right before they go to bed. for people that would be when we get up.
            The Great Ga'Hoole Tree has a big library with all kinds of books. The owls love to go there in their free time.
             They can wake up when ever they want and go to the library. </p>
